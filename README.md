# Plex Radio API

A REST API that simulates radio channels by providing information about the currently playing song from Plex playlists based on the time of day. Each channel generates a daily shuffled playlist and calculates which song should be playing at any given moment.

## Features

- **Time-based playback simulation**: Calculates what song should be playing based on current time
- **Multiple radio channels**: Support for multiple configured channels/playlists
- **Daily playlist generation**: Creates shuffled 24-hour playlists for each channel
- **Current and next song info**: Returns both current and upcoming track details
- **YAML configuration**: Easy configuration of Plex server and channels
- **Direct media links**: Provides direct URLs to media files for playback

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   # or on Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your setup:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example configuration
   cp server/configuration/example_plex_radio_config.yaml server/configuration/plex_radio_config.yaml
   
   # Edit the configuration file
   nano server/configuration/plex_radio_config.yaml
   ```

   Update the configuration with your Plex server details:
   ```yaml
   plex:
     host: "http://your-plex-server-ip:32400"
     token: "your-plex-token"

   channels:
     - name: "Jazz Radio"
       playlist: "Your Jazz Playlist Name"
     - name: "Rock Radio"
       playlist: "Your Rock Playlist Name"
   ```

## Configuration

The API uses a YAML configuration file located at `server/configuration/plex_radio_config.yaml`.

### Getting Your Plex Token
To find your Plex authentication token:
1. Log into your Plex account at https://app.plex.tv
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to any Plex page and look for the `X-Plex-Token` in the network requests
4. Alternatively, use the PlexAPI documentation for token generation

### Configuration Structure
```yaml
plex:
  host: "http://192.168.1.100:32400"  # Your Plex server URL
  token: "your-plex-token-here"       # Your Plex authentication token

channels:
  - name: "Jazz Radio"                # Display name for the channel
    playlist: "Jazz Favorites"        # Exact name of your Plex playlist
  - name: "Rock Radio"
    playlist: "Rock Classics"
```

## Usage

### Option 1: Direct Python Execution

1. Navigate to the server directory and start the API:
   ```bash
   cd server
   python plex_radio_api.py
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Option 2: Docker (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have your configuration file set up:
   ```bash
   cp server/configuration/example_plex_radio_config.yaml server/configuration/plex_radio_config.yaml
   # Edit the configuration with your Plex details
   nano server/configuration/plex_radio_config.yaml
   ```

2. Build and run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Or build and run with Docker directly:
   ```bash
   # Build the image
   docker build -t plex-radio-api .
   
   # Run the container
   docker run -d \
     --name plex-radio-api \
     -p 5000:5000 \
     -v $(pwd)/server/configuration:/app/server/configuration:ro \
     plex-radio-api
   ```

4. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f  # For docker-compose
   docker logs -f plex-radio-api  # For direct docker run
   ```

5. Stop the service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down  # For docker-compose
   docker stop plex-radio-api && docker rm plex-radio-api  # For direct docker run
   ```

### Testing the API

Once running (either method), test the endpoints:
```bash
# Get current song from default channel (channel 0)
curl http://localhost:5000/current-song

# Get current song from specific channel (by number)
curl http://localhost:5000/current-song/1

# List all configured channels
curl http://localhost:5000/channels

# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## How It Works

The API simulates radio stations by:

1. **Daily Playlist Generation**: At startup, it creates shuffled 24-hour playlists for each configured channel
2. **Time-based Calculation**: Uses current time of day (seconds since midnight) to determine position in the playlist
3. **Song Position**: Calculates exactly where within a song playback should start
4. **Seamless Playback**: Provides both current song and next song information for gapless transitions

### Example Workflow:
- At 10:30 AM, if the playlist has been playing since midnight
- Calculate total seconds since midnight: 37,800 seconds
- Find which song should be playing at that time offset
- Return the song with exact start position within that track

## Example Usage with Media Players

### With ffplay
```bash
# Get current song info
response=$(curl -s http://localhost:5000/current-song)

# Extract media link and start time (requires jq)
media_link=$(echo $response | jq -r '.data.media_link')
start_time=$(echo $response | jq -r '.data.start_time')

# Play with ffplay
ffplay -ss $start_time -i "$media_link" -nodisp -autoexit
```

### With VLC (command line)
```bash
vlc --start-time=$start_time "$media_link" --intf dummy --play-and-exit
```

## Docker Configuration

The project includes Docker support for easy deployment:

### Dockerfile Features
- **Multi-stage build** for optimized image size
- **Non-root user** for security
- **Health checks** for container monitoring
- **Production-ready** Flask configuration
- **Volume mounting** for configuration files

### Docker Compose Features
- **Automatic restart** on failure
- **Health monitoring** with built-in checks
- **Volume mapping** for easy configuration updates
- **Network isolation** for security

### Environment Variables
You can override configuration using environment variables:
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production` for production deployment
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: Ensures Python output is not buffered

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for:
- **Plex server connectivity issues**
- **Missing or invalid playlists**
- **Invalid channel numbers**
- **YAML configuration errors**
- **Network timeouts**
- **Invalid requests**

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: Web framework for the REST API
- **PlexAPI**: Python library for Plex server communication  
- **PyYAML**: YAML configuration file parsing
- **Python 3.7+**: Required Python version
- **Docker** (optional): For containerized deployment

## Notes

- The configuration file `plex_radio_config.yaml` is gitignored for security
- Use the `example_plex_radio_config.yaml` as a template
- Each channel generates a new shuffled playlist daily at startup
- Start times are calculated as seconds into the current song
- The API runs in debug mode by default (disable for production)
- Docker deployment automatically runs in production mode
